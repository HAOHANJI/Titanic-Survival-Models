## Titanic Survival Modeling and Analysis based on Machine Learning    	Jun. â€“ Jul. 2021

Employed Python to analyze and compare the pros and cons of various machine learning models of Logistic Regression, K-nearest Neighbor, Neural Network, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine, etc.  

Utilized a variety of metrics to analyze the efficiency of five models and visualized the training results with graphs  

Concluded the optimal model of Support Vector Machine, compared with previous research to determine the effectiveness of the project result.
